      The Autobots (also known as Cybertrons in Japan) are the heroes in the Transformers toyline and related spin-off comics and cartoons. Their main leader is Optimus Prime, but other "Primes" have also commanded the Autobots such as Rodimus Prime. They are constantly at war with the Decepticons. In the U.S. cartoon line, the Autobots were the descendants of a line of robots created as consumer goods by the Quintessons; the Decepticons, are descended instead from robots designed as military hardware.

Other terms for the Autobots are Autorobots (in Italy), Autoboterna (in Sweden), Kibery (in Ukraine), and Robotrikim (in Israel).
